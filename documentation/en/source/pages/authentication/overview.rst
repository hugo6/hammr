Authentication
==============

Communication between hammr and the UForge server is done via HTTPS. To send requests to the UForge server, hammr needs the following information:

* UForge Server URL endpoint
* Your account user name
* Your password

This information can be passed to hammr either from command-line options or from a file.

Command-line Parameters
-----------------------

Authentication information can be passed to hammr via command-line options.  These options are:

* ``-a`` or ``--url``: the UForge Server URL endpoint.  If the URL uses HTTPS, then the connection will be done securely (recommended), otherwise connection will be done via HTTP
* ``-u`` or ``--user``: the user name to use for authentication
* ``-p`` or ``--password``: the password to use for authentication

For example

.. code-block:: shell

	$ hammr os list --url https://uforge.usharesoft.com/api -u username -p password

These parameters need to be passed each time you want to use the command-line.

Using a Credential File
=======================

Rather than passing the authentication information as part of the command-line, you can instead store this information in a credential file (``credentials.json`` or ``credentials.yml``) that will be used every time hammr is launched.  Hammr searches for this file in a sub-directory named ``.hammr`` located in the home directory of the user launching hammr.

To use a credential file, go to the ``.hammr`` sub-directory and create the file ``credentials.yml``.

.. code-block:: shell

	$ cd ~/.hammr
	$ vi credentials.yml

Add the authentication and UForge URL endpoint to this file, using the following format:

.. code-block:: yaml

	---
	user: root
	password: password
	url: https://uforge.usharesoft.com/api

As this file contains security information, it is recommended to change the permissions on this file so that only you can read or write to it:

.. code-block:: shell

	$ chmod 600 credentials.yml

Now every time hammr is launched, you no longer need to provide the authentication information as part of the command-line.  Hammr will automatically use the information contained in this file.
