Disks
=====

The first thing a partitioning table needs is to declare one or more disks that will be used to partition. Each disk declared in the partitioning table has the name ``sd`` followed by a letter, starting at ``a``, namely: 1st disk ``sda``, 2nd disk ``sdb`` and so on. A disk may have one of two types, either ``MSDOS`` or ``LVM`` and provide a total disk size available. LVM disks cannot have any physical partitions, however can be used in logical volumes (we will touch on this subject later).

The example below describes 1 disk of 20GB.

.. code-block:: yaml

	---
	installation:
	  partitioning:
		disks:
		- name: sda
		  type: msdos
		  size: 20480

Example
-------

The following example describes 2 disks of 20GB each.

.. code-block:: yaml

	---
	installation:
	  partitioning:
		disks:
		- name: sda
		  type: msdos
		  size: 20480
		- name: sdb
		  type: msdos
		  size: 20480
