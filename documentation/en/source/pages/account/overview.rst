Your Account
============

As you discovered in the Introduction, hammr allows you to communicate with and use the UForge server to create, build and publish machine images. Since you are communicating with UForge, a number of actions are managed by your UForge Account, such as the operating systems you have access to, any quotas set (on the number of images you can create, for example), as well as managing your cloud account. The following sections will help you use hammr to access information from your UForge cloud account.
