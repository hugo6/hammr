For building an image, the valid keys are:

* ``type`` (mandatory): a string providing the machine image type to build. Default builder type for QCOW2: ``QCOW2``. To get the available builder type, please refer to :ref:`command-line-format`
* ``hardwareSettings`` (mandatory): an object providing hardware settings to be used for the machine image. The following valid keys for hardware settings are:
	* ``memory`` (mandatory): an integer providing the amount of RAM to provide to an instance provisioned from the machine image (in MB).
* ``installation`` (optional): an object providing low-level installation or first boot options. These override any installation options in the :ref:`template-stack` section. The following valid keys for installation are:
	* ``diskSize`` (mandatory): an integer providing the disk size of the machine image to create. Note, this overrides any disk size information in the stack. This cannot be used if an advanced partitioning table is defined in the stack.
